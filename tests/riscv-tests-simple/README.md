# RISC-V Test Simple

The tests code use here here are mainly copied from the [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests) repo from riscv organization. See LICENSE for the original license requirement.

I modified the code for my CPU design verification.

## Build the IMEM dump file

Just run `make` in the linux shell and it will generate the asm dump and the instruction memory content verilog file for each tests

## Modifications

This section lists all the modification I made on the original riscv-tests repo.

- Using rv64ui tests as rv32ui tests.
  - In the original repo, the rv32ui tests are actually linked to rv64ui test. Since our cpu only support 32 bits, I directly copied the rv64ui as rv32ui and changed the variable name in Makefrag

- Changes include/header files
  - I moved all the include/header file from its original source folder into **env** folder. Only encoding.h, riscv_test.h, test_macro.h are used. link.ld is also placed into env folder

- Changes in link.ld
  - The base address is changed from 0x80000000 to 0x00000000

- Rewrite the riscv_test.h file.
  - The original files is running with privilege mode and including many instructions that my CPU does not support right now so the code is largely rewritten base on the original framework
  - Removed all the un-used macros.
  - Rewrite the `RVTEST_CODE_BEGIN` macro: Removed most of the isntruction and only include register initialization
  - Rewrite the `RVTEST_PASS` and `RVTEST_FAIL` macro: When test passes, it will write 1, 2, 3 to register x1, x2, x3 respectively. When test fails, it will write 0xf, x0f, 0xf register x1, x2, x3 respectively. User can check the registe value to determine if the test passes or not
  - Rewrite the `RVTEST_DATA_BEGIN` macro: Removd most of the content there.
