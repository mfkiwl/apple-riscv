# Development Log

## Milestone 0.1

- 04/19/2021
  - **[RTL Bug Fix]** Fixed bugs found in tests for csr instruction and exception
    - Fixed bug in mcsr module: wrong mie and mtvec address
    - Fixed bug in dmem_ctrl module: do not read/store memory when there is address misalign exception
    - Fixed bug in cpu: wb stage also need flushing when there are exception happends at mem stage. For example, we need to disable rd_wr when there is load_addr misalign in mem stage
    - Fixed bug in decode logic: corrected logic for invalid instruction detection
    - Fixed bug in trap ctrl module: ecall should trigger pc_trap too.
  - Added more isa tests for csr instruction and exception.

- 04/18/2021
  - Implemented interrupt logic and added few more csr register
  - Updated pipeline logic for zicsr and exception
  - Implemented mret and ecall instruction
  - **[RTL Bug Fix]** Fixed bugs found in tests for csr instruction
    - Fixed bug in hdu logic: there are data dependency on csr instruction, need to add stall logic
    - Fixed bug in mcsr module: missing csr output decode for mscratch register
    - Fixed bug in csr logic: csrrs logic is wrong. The original logic also clear other bits that are not set. It should only set bit
    - Fixed bug in decode logic: csrrw/csrrs/csrrc also read rs1, need to set rs1_rd

- 04/17/2021
  - Designed the csr module and exception logic
  - Implemented the 'Zicsr' csr related instructions

- 04/14/2021
  - Updated instruction decoder logic.
    - Using switch structure for decode logic

- 04/09/2021
  - Updated register file
    - Using single ram instead of two.
  - Updated memory
    - Reduced the size so it can be synthesis in Arty A7 FPGA board
    - Renamed the memory name.
    - Added a debug port on instruction and bring the port to top level.
    - With the debug port FPGA synthesis will not optimize out the instruction memory

- 04/08/2021
  - Moved hazard detection logic and forwarding logic into its own module.

- 04/07/2021
  - **[RTL Bug Fix]** Fixed bugs found in the tests.
    - Fixed bug in forwarding logic: need to check whether the write dest is x0 or not. If it is x0 then do not forward the data
    - Fixed bug in forwarding logic: jalr also read rs1
  - Enhanced the test framework for riscv-test
    - Update the cocotb run.py and makefile flow
    - Added a python script to run all the tests and gather result
  - **[TB Bug Fix]** Updated the tb file on how to load instruction rom. Added the ability to load data rom (for testing load instruction)
    - Now the data in the `.verilog` file is represented by 1 byte (rather than by word).
    - We need it to be byte because the .verilog file specify the address as the absolute byte address (such as @10 (in hex)) but verilog $readmemh treat the address as the index of the defined memory register. For example, if we define reg [31:0] mem[0:1023] then @10 will write the data into mem[10] instead of mem[4] even though each memory block is 4 bytes.
  - Updated the bus system. Using AHB-lite as I-mem and D-mem bus.

- 04/06/2021
  - Added some sample riscv-test code.
    - The codes are mainly copied from riscv-tests repo.
    - Made some modification to make it compatiable to my cpu design.
    - Check the tests/riscv-tests-simple/README.md for more details.
  - Created the cocotb test environment for the riscv-test.
    - Added the makefile and the main test program `run.py`
    - Updated the tb file so it can load the instruction rom generated by riscv-test
  - Updated documents.

## Milestone 0.0

Completed the basic RV32I instruction iplementation exception for FANCE, ECALL, EBREAK

- 04/05/2021
  - Major updates on the existing code.
    - Re-designed the ALU logic. Now different operation will share the same operation resources
      if they require the same operation.
    - Re-designed the decode logic based on the new ALU logic.
    - Renamed some signals and modules
  - Implemented jal/jalr instruction.
    - SpinalHDL design and cocotb sanity_check code.

- 04/04/2021
  - Implemented lui/auipc Instruction
    - SpinalHDL design and cocotb sanity_check code.

- 04/03/2021
  - Change on immediate value logic
    - Moved the signed extension logic from the EX stage to ID stage
    - Stores the entire 32 bit immediate value in ID/EX stage pipeline to reduce the work on EX stage
  - Implemented Branch Instruction
    - SpinalHDL design and cocotb sanity_check code.

- 04/01/2021
  - Updated the test directory and cocotb test environment
  - Wrote tests for the load/store instruction
  - Major design updates and bug fixes
